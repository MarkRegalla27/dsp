[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77) (scoring)

```
Exponential distribution with n = 10, Lambda = 2, and 1000 iterations:
Standard Error = 1.33950656795
Confidence Inverval (5 - 95%) = (1.3238998686302594, 3.7375992366213442)
```
Not sure how to get my plots to show.  They are saved in my directory folder where I am keeping my code.
Any feedback on how to do this would be greatly appreciated!
